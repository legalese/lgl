#+TITLE: LGL SDK TESTS

* Testing the lgl executable

The test suite runs the lgl executable against given command-line parameters and STDIN inputs. The STDOUT from the executable is compared against known expectations.

* Testing the library

The test suite directly calls the library functions exposed by the SDK. Most of those library functions map to back-end endpoints. The output of those function calls is compared against known expectations.

* Components

** Account Creation

** Bizfile

** Proforma

** Workflow

** Payment

* Testing the endpoints

The server-side API endpoints are implicitly tested as part of the tests of the library and lgl executable.

In future, we could do curl-based testing if an independent channel of coverage is desired.
